# meme-code-beutifyer
don't you hate how you the semicolon and squiggly brackets touch your code, ewww 🤮.

wouldn't it be better to keep them nice and organised in a nice straight line on the right side of the screen, just run you code thru this code beautifier and watch them all line up, nice and out of the way.

END OF JOKE READ ME

Some years ago there was a tweet making a joke about lining up all the semicolons and braces on the right side of the screen that became a meme.
i don't think this is the original inventor, but it is all i could find while setting up this repo.

This is a code beautifier that does just that, properly indents the lines, then lines up all the braces and semicolons with the longest line in the program.
look at the source for an example of what it does.

it was written in javascript in a <script> tag to make it as easy as possible to run so people can actually try it. I don't normally use javascript much so it is even worse that if it was in a language i am more familiar with.

i would not deliver a product of this quality normally, but this is not for actual use so it is ok. Honestly the joke stopped being funny before I was done coding.

there are significant problems with this, it is for humour value only
